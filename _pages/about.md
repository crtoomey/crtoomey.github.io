Hi, my name is Colin Toomey. I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional who is looking to get hired as a SOC Analyst in the near future. I have quite a few interests and hobbies like playing chess, playing video games, reading, and writing. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science from SUNY Canton where I am majoring in Cybersecurity.

If you would like to see some of my write-ups on Capture-the-Flags, home labs, what projects I am currently working on, and more, visit the [blog](https://crtoomey.github.io/blog/) page. The [projects](https://crtoomey.github.io/projects/) page has all of my completed web development and cybersecurity projects, feel free to take a look.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
